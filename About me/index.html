    <p>Hello! I am a country guy who is a goofy nerd with an obesession with starwars and would love to live in a fantasy world.</p>
        <p>I served as a missionary in the philippines for 15 months and due to covid had to be reassigned to the Las Vegas North Mission for my remaining time.</p>
        <p>I want to become a game developer and I am persuing education with that goal in mind.</p>
        <p>My favorite scripture is 1st Nephi 3:7, I truly believe that God would not have us do something unless he has prepared us, and prepared a way for us to complete what he commanded us to accomplish.</p>
