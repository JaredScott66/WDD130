      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you been curious about a character in Star-Wars? They being clouded in mystery or their information is just hard to find? I aim to create a site that will bring those extra details to light in a way that is easy to find and understand.
        With the new shows that are coming out now, it leaves new viewers wondering where these characters came from and why they are important. I am a hardcore Star-Wars fan, so I have viewed and read almost everything about it. Which has allowed me to learn many details that others wouldn’t know. I will categorize each character onto the site and put those stories and details I have learned there, so others can learn and appreciate a deeper look into the Star-Wars universe.  
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>With there being so many new shows out now, there are many people who may be new to the Star Wars universe. It can be daunting to try and learn about a particular character without watching everything they have shown up in. This site is aimed to those people.
        Instead of watching everything, they can instead look up the character and all of their information is in one place, making it easier to understand them. And by so doing, grants them a greater appreciation of the characters and their stories.
