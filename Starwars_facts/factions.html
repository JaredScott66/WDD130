       <h3>Factions</h3>
       <p>
        From the events of “The Fantom Menace” to the end of “Rise of Sky Walker” is a time span of 67 years. 
        There are 3 major conflicts that span this time. The Old Republic vs The Separatists, The Rebellion against the Empire and The First Order against the Resistance. 
        All of these characters can fall into one of these factions, whether they fought for the light side, or for the dark side.

        <p>The Galactic Republic, also known as the Grand Republic or simply as the Republic, was a democratic union of sovereign star systems spread across
            light-years of space. Old Republic was a term affixed to the pre-modern Republic, and the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire. 
            The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 years before the events of The Battle of Yavin, around the 
            same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing 
            the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the head of the Republic, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on 
            Coruscant. An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.

        <p>The Confederacy of Independent Systems, also known as the Confederacy, the CIS, the Separatist Confederacy, the 
            Separatist Alliance, the Separatist State, the New Order, the pro-secessionists; or colloquially as the Separatists, 
            Seps, or Sepies; was the government and separatist movement led by Darth Sidious and his apprentice Count Dooku. 
            Formed by various planetary and sectorial governments, as well as some mega-corporations, that declared intentions 
            to leave the Galactic Republic, refusing to comply with its excessive taxation and corruption in the Senate during 
            the Separatist Crisis.
