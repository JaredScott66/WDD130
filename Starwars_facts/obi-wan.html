        <p>Obi-wan Kenobi the wise and stoic man of honor. Upholder of the Jedi code and has been involved in 
            many of the major conflicts seen throughout Star Wars, most of which took place during the clone wars of which he was a commanding general of the clone army. 
            He also held a seat on the Jedi high counsel with other Jedi Masters such as Mace Windu, Plo Koon, Kit Fisto and Yoda. As with all Jedi, he was taken from a very 
            young age to be trained as Jedi, spending he younger years as a youngling in the Jedi temple, being instructed in the Jedi way and the way of the force. He was then 
            taken as an apprentice under Jedi master Qui-gon Jin. He followed Qui-gon Jin as he was tasked as mediator and peace keeper, learning in the shadow of a Jedi master. 
            Obi-wan excelled in lightsaber combat.
