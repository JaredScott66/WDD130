        young age to be trained as Jedi, spending he younger years as a youngling in the Jedi temple, being instructed in the Jedi way and the way of the force. He was then 
        taken as an apprentice under Jedi master Qui-gon Jin. He followed Qui-gon Jin as he was tasked as mediator and peace keeper, learning in the shadow of a Jedi master. 
        Obi-wan excelled in light saber combat.
